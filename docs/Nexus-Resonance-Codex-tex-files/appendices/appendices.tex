	\section{Historical \& Heuristic Origins}
	The development of the Nexus Resonance Codex was initially motivated by cross-comparisons of several well-known numerical and geometric patterns: the golden ratio $\phi$ and its modular cycles, Fibonacci-related sequences and Pisano periods, recurring digit cycles (particularly emphasis on residues 3, 6, 9 as noted in historical scientific literature attributed to N. Tesla), and geometric proportions in ancient structures (e.g., Great Pyramid of Giza slope $\approx \arctan(\sqrt{\phi}) \approx 51.827^\circ$).
	
	These exploratory comparisons revealed consistent modular avoidance patterns in certain residue classes modulo 9, which led to the formal definition of the 3--6--9--7 modular exclusion principle. While such patterns have been discussed anecdotally in secondary sources, they are used here solely as heuristic starting points. All mathematical results stand independently on standard definitions, proofs, and reproducible computations.
