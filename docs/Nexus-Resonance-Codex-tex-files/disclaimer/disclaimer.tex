The author notes that certain motivating observations draw from historical geometric ratios and recurring digit patterns. These are presented solely as heuristic origin points and are not used as foundational arguments. All claims herein stand independently on standard mathematical definitions, verifiable identities, and reproducible computations. Independent verification is encouraged through the supplied Python snippets, which require only standard scientific libraries.
