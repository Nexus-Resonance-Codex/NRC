\section{Conclusion \& Future Directions}

The Nexus Resonance Codex presents a unified mathematical framework that integrates golden-ratio exponential weighting, modular arithmetic cycles, residue-class exclusion filters, and multi-scale tensor transforms. All core results are supported by complete proofs where algebraically possible and by extensive numerical/modular verification otherwise.

Key verified contributions include entire $\phi$-weighted Dirichlet series, the 3-6-9-7 modular exclusion principle, five transforms with reproducible properties, and high-dimensional entropy scaling. Empirical observations in protein cores and numerical links to open problems provide promising directions for further research.

Future work includes rigorous proof of the golden critical-line conjecture, large-scale PDB mining, lattice cryptographic constructions, experimental piezoelectric arrays, and extensions to non-power moduli.

The NRC provides a novel, reproducible toolkit for number-theoretic filtering, spectral regularization, and high-dimensional modeling --- with potential impact across pure mathematics, cryptography, structural biology, and materials science.
